LunarForecast is an interactive 3D globe web application built with Three.js and WebGL. It provides a visually immersive platform for exploring real-time global weather, geographical, and astronomical data. The application renders a detailed model of the Earth with dynamic day/night textures, clouds, and an atmospheric glow.
It addresses the challenge of creating an engaging data visualization tool by moving beyond traditional flat maps. Users can search for or click on any location to place a pin and retrieve detailed information from multiple APIs, including current weather, 7-day forecasts, air quality, sunrise/sunset times, and moon phases, all presented in a comprehensive modal.
